Openshift is more enterprise ready distribution. It will have all the necessary operators/ingredients needed for enterprise.  
whereas in Minikube we need to configure what ever we needed.    

CodeReady Container is nothing but a single node cluster like minikube.  

Methods of Installation:   

* Installer-Provisioned  -- Infrastructure will be provided by third party.   
* User-Provisioned  -- Infrastructure should be prepared by the user like using VM.  
* Laptop/Desktop --- uses codeReady Containers.    

CodeReady Container is just a VM.   

* Runs in a single VM, brings a minimal OpenShift v4 Cluster to our desktop.   
We won't use this for production, as this is a single node cluster.  
We will atleast maintain 3 master nodes.
